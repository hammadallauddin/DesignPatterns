> Builder pattern builds a complex object using simple objects and using a step by step approach. This type of design pattern comes under creational pattern as this pattern provides one of the best ways to create an object.

> A Builder class builds the final object step by step. This builder is independent of other objects.

> Used to create object made from a brunch of objects
    -> When you want to build an object made up from other objects
    -> When you want the creation of these parts to be independent of the main object
    -> Hide the creation of part from the client so they are not dependent
    -> The builder knows the specifics and nobody else
